# From Scratch  

Its as easy as [pulling the docker container](#Pull-the-Docker-Container), [having docker build our project image](#Run-the-Docker-Container-to-Build-Our-Project-Image), and [flashing the SD Card](#Flash-the-SD-Card)!  
<sub>With the caviot that **_maybe_** you'll need to [install docker](#Install-Docker) if you don't already have it [see here](Install-Docker)</sub>  


## Important Preamble

Ubuntu 18.04 on x86_64 system used as Host/Build system. Others not tested.  
As of the date of writing, version 4.3 does not support the 2GB version.  
A clarification as provided by nVidia:  
> A Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit includes a non-production specification Jetson module (P3448-0003) attached to a reference carrier board (P3542-0000).  
> This user guide covers two revisions of the developer kit:  
>
> * Part Number 945-13541-0000-000 including 802.11ac wireless adapter and cable  
> * Part Number 945-13541-0001-000 NOT including adapter and cable  

We are targeting to build for the module, which means the default was set to `P3448-0003`.  

## Pull the Docker Container

Get the docker container with everything neccessary to build by executing `docker pull calebprovost/dockter-l4t:sdk_installed` (be prepared... its ~10G).  

If you wish to adjust the environments and/or the docker container, you can find the source here: [CalebProvost/dockter-l4t](https://github.com/CalebProvost/dockter-l4t)  
<sub>**Info:** Executing the `build.sh` outside of the Docker container will fail. It is a script which runs automatically by and inside the docker container itself.</sub>  

## Run the Docker Container to Build Our Project Image  

Run the following command to build our project image for the `jetson-nano-2gb-devkit` board with our custom program code in it.
`docker run -it -v $PWD:/home/user/build --name dl4t calebprovost/dockter-l4t:sdk_installed bash -c ./build.sh`

If you'd like to build the OE4T demo image without our layer and code, execute the container eithout the appended command like so:  
`docker run -it -v $PWD:/home/user/build --rm calebprovost/dockter-l4t:sdk_installed`

## Flash the SD Card

The SD Card image is created using the L4T SD Card tools and placed in the root of this directory. It's default name will be "demo-image-full-jetson-nano-2gb-devkit.img" but will follow the following naming convention if the defaults were overwritten in the prior steps: `"${BUILD_IMAGE}-${MACHINE}.img"`  

Use your flavor of SD Card flashing tool (like balenaEtcher for Windows or `dd` for linux) and flash the provided image onto an SD card and insert into the Jetson nano to start having fun.  

Note: An SD Card sized ~16GB will be needed. We found that our image was 300MB too large and thus used a 32GB card instead.  


## Install Docker  

See the latest installation method for your distro from Docker's website.  
The following was used to install on the **_host_** build system:  

* Install the package dependencies

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
    ```

* Add Docker Keys  

    ```shell
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
    sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    ```

* Add Docker's repository to the package manager

    ```shell
    echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

* Install Docker

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install docker.io
    ```

* Follow the [post-install steps for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/). </br>
Most importantly, create a new group called docker and add your username to it. **Changes take affect upon logging in again (reboot)**: </br>
`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker && su -l $USER`  

**_Optional_:** If you'd like to change the docker storage location to an external device, feel free to do the following:  

* Edit /etc/docker/daemon.json (if it doesnâ€™t exist, create it) and include:

    ```json
    {
    "data-root": "/new/path/to/docker-data"
    }
    ```

* Then restart Docker with:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
